# DateBox6

This is indeed another re-write of datebox.  In modern javascript.

Things that won't make the cut:

* jquery-mobile.
* IE.
* Probably lots more.

This may never be usable software, I'm really more curious what the state of browser based javascript is these days.  Everything will be re-worked, so expect a very long process.
